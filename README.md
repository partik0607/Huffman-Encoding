# Huffman-Encoding
Huffman Coding is a technique of compressing data to reduce its size without losing any of the details. It was first developed by David Huffman.
Huffman Coding is generally useful to compress the data in which there are frequently occurring characters.
Using the Huffman Coding technique, we can compress the string to a smaller size.
Huffman coding first creates a tree using the frequencies of the character and then generates code for each character.
Once the data is encoded, it has to be decoded. Decoding is done using the same tree.
